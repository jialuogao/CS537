Usage: project3b.py [options] tests...

Run specified tests on the project. By default, all tests are run.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            Print a list of all available tests and their
                        descriptions
  -c, --continue        Continue testing after a test failure
  -n, --no-copy         By default, the project is copied to a local temp
                        directory before testing to avoid the poor performance
                        of AFS. This option disables that behavior. This
                        option along with --stop may be useful for debugging,
                        since the project can be examined after a failed test
  -p PROJECT_PATH, --project-path=PROJECT_PATH
                        Path to the directory containing the project to be
                        tested (default: current directory)
  -t TESTER_PATH, --test-path=TESTER_PATH
                        Path to the location of the test files
  -q, --quiet           
  -m, --no-timeout      Ignore timeouts on tests
  -g, --gdb             Run project executable inside a gdb session. implies
                        -m
  -v, --valgrind        Run project executable inside a valgrind session.
  -b, --no-build        do not automatically run build test before running
                        other tests
  -f FACTOR, --factor=FACTOR
                        multiply all timeout lengths by FACTOR
